# Maritime-Delay-Analysis
End-to-end analysis of maritime vessel delays using Excel, Python, and SQL Server 
# Maritime Delay Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes maritime vessel delays to understand operational performance,
identify major delay causes, and evaluate port efficiency.

The analysis uses cleaned Excel data imported into SQL Server and explores delay
patterns using structured SQL queries.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning & preparation)
- Python (data expansion, validation, and logic check)
- SQL Server (data storage & querying)
- GitHub (version control & documentation)

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The project uses two datasets:

### 1. Maritime Operations Fact Table
Contains vessel-level operational data, including:
- Vessel ID
- Port
- Delay Days
- Delay Status (On Time / Late)

### 2. Delay Reasons Dimension Table
Contains standardized delay reasons such as:
- Weather
- Crew Issues
- Technical Problems
- Port Congestion

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Total vessel movements analysis
- Delay status distribution (On Time vs Late)
- Average delay duration for delayed vessels
- Port-level delay performance comparison

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Approximately 50% of vessel movements were completed on time
- Delayed vessels showed measurable average delay durations
- Delay patterns varied by port, indicating operational differences
