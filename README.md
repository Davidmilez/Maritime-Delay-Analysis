# Maritime Delay Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes vessel delays across multiple ports using Excel, Python, and SQL.
The goal is to evaluate on-time performance, identify high-risk ports, and understand
key delay drivers in maritime operations.

## Dataset
- Vessel arrival, berthing, and departure records
- Planned vs actual turnaround time
- Delay reasons and operational costs

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel (initial data cleaning & validation)
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- SQL Server (fact & dimension modeling, analysis)
- GitHub (version control)

## Analysis Performed
- Delay calculation and classification (Early / On Time / Late)
- KPI analysis (On-time performance, high-risk exposure)
- Port-level risk assessment
- Delay reason frequency and impact
- Star-schema style modeling (Fact & Dimension tables)

## Key Insights
- Only ~15% of vessels arrived on time
- Over 50% of vessels fall into high-risk delay categories
- Certain ports consistently show higher average delays
- Weather and port congestion are major delay drivers
